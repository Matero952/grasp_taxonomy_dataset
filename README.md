# grasp_taxonomy_dataset
Grasp taxonomy dataset for Correll Lab
Not sure how I'm gonna do the taxonomy(contact region maybe?) but it needs to be organized by tool/equipment.
One cool thing that I have seen is computing the potential force that a grasp can apply to an object and then classifying
it as either a power grasp or a precesion grasp-I think that this could be very beneficial to classification.
